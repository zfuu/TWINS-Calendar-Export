## TWINS-Calendar-Export

This is a quick Python tool designed for students using TWINS at University of Tsukuba.
The script takes your UTID logins and automatically gets the course registration information from TWINS. It then compares the course information to the KdB database and exports a ics calendar file for you to import into a calendar app of your own choice.
